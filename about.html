  <h2>👩‍💻 About Me</h2>

<p>
  I’m <strong>Ekta Sharma</strong>, a Software Development graduate from the <strong>Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (2023–2024)</strong> with a growing specialization in IT systems, data infrastructure, and full-stack web development. My background bridges both development and research-focused support — making me well-suited for roles at the intersection of software, data, and technical operations.
</p>

<p>
  My education and projects have equipped me with hands-on experience using modern technologies like <strong>JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Firebase</strong>, where I’ve built responsive, high-performance web applications. I’ve worked on personal and client-facing projects with a strong focus on maintainability, performance, and user-centered design.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to development, I’m passionate about data-driven problem solving and technical system support. I’ve worked extensively with <strong>SQL, MySQL, and MongoDB</strong> — writing queries, optimizing schemas, and managing backend data flows. I enjoy tackling technical challenges, supporting end-users, and improving workflows in dynamic environments such as healthcare, research, and academia.
</p>

<p>
  I also bring strong interpersonal skills and a collaborative mindset, with experience working across diverse teams. I thrive in environments where troubleshooting, continuous learning, and impact-driven work are valued.
